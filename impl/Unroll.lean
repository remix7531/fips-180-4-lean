# Loop unrolling helpers

`Fin.foldl n f init` compiles (after `@[specialize]`) to a tail-recursive
loop, but the per-round counter still runs through `lean_nat_*` ops on
the `Fin n` index — modulo, subtraction, less-than-check — every
iteration.  Crypto inner loops in this project (SHA-256's 64-round
compression, SHA-512's 80-round compression, …) read the schedule from
`block[(i - k) % 16]`, so per-iteration counter arithmetic is on the
hot path.

A manual unroll with literal `Fin` indices lets the codegen
constant-fold `(i - k) % 16` to a literal slot, eliminating the
counter arithmetic entirely.  The resulting C is straight-line code
with explicit literal indices.

Each unroll function pairs an explicit unrolled body (for codegen)
with an equivalence theorem `… = Fin.foldl n …` (for proofs); the
equivalence is proven once via the generic `unrollN` recursion and
applies uniformly to any step function.

/-! ## Generic recursive unroll

`unrollN n g init` is structurally equal to `Fin.foldl n g init`,
but written so that for a *concrete* literal `n` and a step function
`g` the term reduces by definitional `rfl` to a chain of `n` explicit
applications of `g` at literal `Fin n` indices (modulo `castSucc`s).

This is the bridge between the hand-unrolled `unroll64` / `unroll80`
forms below (which are 64- / 80-deep `let` chains for codegen) and
`Fin.foldl n` (which is what the equivalence proofs are stated
against). -/
